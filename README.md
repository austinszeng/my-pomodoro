## Personal goals for this project
- Gain more frontend development experience by building a project with a few more elements
- Learn from an existing project
- Learn to modify and expand an existing project to my liking
- Get a better understanding of the different types of elements when developing a website
- Build something that I would actually want to use (and will use) 

## Ideas
- Give users color theme choices
- Give users time choices in increments of 5mins from 25mins to (3hrs?) and 5min to 45min breaks'
- Give users sound options
- Smooth progress bar
- ~~Add a 1-3 second pause when it switches to break~~
- Implement mini spotify/youtube player on website for music?!
